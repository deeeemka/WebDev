/*  1)Math is a built-in object that provides mathematical operations. We will learn it in the chapter Numbers. Here, it serves just as an example of an object.
    2)The result of typeof null is "object". That’s an officially recognized error in typeof, coming from very early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, null is not an object. It is a special value with a separate type of its own. The behavior of typeof is wrong here.
    3)The result of typeof alert is "function", because alert is a function. We’ll study functions in the next chapters where we’ll also see that there’s no special “function” type in JavaScript. Functions belong to the object type. But typeof treats them differently, returning "function". That also comes from the early days of JavaScript. Technically, such behavior isn’t correct, but can be convenient in practice.
